          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>Hello my name is Will Schickler! I am a 26 year old male currently attending the University of Oregon coding boot camp. My main hobby and passion is cars and drifting.
          I have a 1989 Nissan Skyline R32 Gtst and go drifting down at Affinity circuit down in Medford Oregon. I have been drifting for about 3 years now and have been loving every second of it.
          My main goal with drifting is going to a style based competition called "Final Bout" with my friends. I Joined the U of O boot camp to get my foot in the door in this new and ever changing 
          world of coding. I am excited to see where this new skill takes me and what I can do with it.
