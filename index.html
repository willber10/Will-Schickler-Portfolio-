          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>Hello my name is Will Schickler! I am a 26 year old male currently attending the University of Oregon coding boot camp. My main hobby and passion is cars and drifting.
          I have a 1989 Nissan Skyline R32 Gtst and go drifting down at Affinity circuit down in Medford Oregon. I have been drifting for about 3 years now and have been loving every second of it.
          My main goal with drifting is going to a style based competition called "Final Bout" with my friends. What got me into Coding and wanting to learn more about this new and intriguing world is
          my father! My Dad has been working for IBM for a little over 27 years now, watching him grow and learn about this tech industry has been something ever present in my life for as long as I can
          remember. Seeing how far he has come is motivation for me to continue to learn and grow in this industry. I am excited to see where this new journey takes me and I am excited to see what I can do with it!
